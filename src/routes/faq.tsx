          >
            <p>
              PointPals is a family habit app that turns chores, kindness, and positive habits into
              points that fill a shared marble jar. When the jar is full, the family celebrates
              together with a reward you choose as a team.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&rsquo;s designed for families who are tired of nagging, bribing, and power struggles
              over everyday tasks. Instead of fighting about chores, families track progress together
              and celebrate effort.

            question="How does the marble jar work?"
          >
            <p>
              Every time a child completes a chore, shows kindness, or practises a positive habit, a
              parent taps to award points. Each point drops a marble into the family&rsquo;s shared
              jar. When the jar reaches its target, the whole family gets to celebrate with a
              pre-agreed reward.
            </p>
            <p>
              The jar is shared — every child&rsquo;s contribution fills it together. This encourages
              teamwork rather than competition between siblings.

            question="What ages is PointPals for?"
          >
            <p>
              PointPals works best for children aged 3–14. For toddlers, keep tasks very simple
              (putting toys away, brushing teeth with help). For tweens and teens, involve them in
              setting their own goals and rewards so the system feels respectful, not babyish.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key is matching the complexity of the chore to the child&rsquo;s developmental
              stage. We have age-appropriate chore suggestions in our{" "}

            question="Can I use it with more than one child?"
          >
            <p>Yes. PointPals is built for families with multiple children. Each child can:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>Have their own set of chores and habits</li>
              <li>Earn points individually for their own effort</li>
              <li>See their contribution fill the shared family jar</li>
              <li>Choose their own character (Sunny, Pip, Bramble, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The shared jar is one of our most important features — it turns chore time from
              sibling competition into teamwork.

            <p>
              Yes. Multiple parents or caregivers can join the same household. Each adult can award
              points to any child, so both Mum and Dad (or other caregivers) stay in the loop.
            </p>

              This also means grandparents, babysitters, or other trusted adults can be included if

          >
            <p>
              The best rewards are shared experiences, not things. Screen time is an easy default,
              but research shows it can backfire as a reward (see our{" "}
              <Link to="/about" className="underline hover:text-foreground">
                research page
              </Link>
              ). Instead, try:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>Family movie night with popcorn</li>
              <li>Pancakes for breakfast</li>
              <li>A trip to the playground or beach</li>
              <li>Camping in the lounge</li>
              <li>Baking together</li>
              <li>A board game night</li>
              <li>Choosing the family dinner</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Involve your children in choosing rewards — they&rsquo;ll be more invested when they
              helped pick the goal.

              <li>1 point for simple daily tasks (brushing teeth, putting shoes away)</li>
              <li>2 points for bigger chores (clearing the table, unpacking the dishwasher)</li>
              <li>3 points for extra effort, kindness, or doing something without being asked</li>
            </ul>

          <FaqItem
            id="isnt-bribery"
            question="Isn't this just bribery?"
          >
            <p>
              This is the most common question, and it deserves an honest answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bribery is offering a reward <em>after</em> a behaviour has already started, often to
              stop something going wrong. PointPals works differently — it&rsquo;s a pre-agreed
              system where expectations are clear before anyone earns or loses anything.
            </p>
            <p>
              Research shows that external rewards are most effective for tasks that lack intrinsic
              motivation — like most chores. The goal is to <em>fade</em> the rewards over time as
              habits become automatic and children begin to feel the intrinsic satisfaction of
              contributing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The difference between a bribe and a system: a bribe is reactive. A system is
              intentional.

          <FaqItem
            id="can-lose-points"
            question="Can children lose points for misbehaving?"
          >
            <p>
              Yes — but with important caveats. PointPals allows you to remove a marble as a
              consequence, and the research supports this when used thoughtfully.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key distinction: this is <em>response cost</em>, not punishment. A marble
              disappearing is a clean, immediate signal — not a parent yelling, threatening, or
              shaming. The system delivers the consequence, so the parent stays in the role of
              coach, not punisher.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neuroscience supports this approach. The prefrontal cortex — which connects actions to
              consequences — is the last part of the brain to develop. An immediate, concrete signal
              (chime + marble removal) helps children make that connection in real time.
            </p>
            <p>
              That said, the marble jar works best when it&rsquo;s <em>primarily</em> about building
              progress. If you&rsquo;re removing marbles more than adding them, something else needs
              attention — usually the underlying relationship or expectations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              <strong>Suggested guidelines:</strong> pre-agree the rules, keep removals rare, stay
              warm when delivering them, and separate the behaviour from the child. See our{" "}
              <Link to="/about" className="underline hover:text-foreground">

          <FaqItem
            id="child-refuses"
            question="What if my child refuses to do a chore?"
          >
            <p>
              Start with connection, not consequences. Ask what&rsquo;s going on — is the task too
              hard? Too boring? Is there something else on their mind?
            </p>
            <p>
              If it&rsquo;s a pattern, consider whether the chore is age-appropriate, whether the
              expectations are clear, and whether the relationship needs attention first.
            </p>
            <p>
              The marble jar is most effective when it&rsquo;s used to <em>notice</em> progress, not
              to <em>enforce</em> compliance. A child who feels capable and connected is far more
              likely to help than one who feels controlled.

            id="child-loses-interest"
            question="What if my child loses interest in the system?"
          >
            <p>
              This is normal, especially after the initial novelty wears off. A few things to try:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Refresh the rewards.</strong> Let the child help choose a new reward goal.</li>
              <li><strong>Add new chores.</strong> Rotate in fresh tasks or increase the challenge.</li>
              <li><strong>Change the target.</strong> A smaller jar fills faster — early wins build momentum.</li>
              <li><strong>Take a break.</strong> Sometimes the system needs a pause. Habits that are already formed will likely stick.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Interest naturally ebbs and flows. That&rsquo;s not failure — it&rsquo;s family life.
