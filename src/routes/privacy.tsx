      <p>
        PointPals is a family chore and behaviour tracker. We take privacy seriously — especially
        because the app involves data about children. This policy explains what we collect, why, and
        the control you have.
      </p>

      <H2>What we collect</H2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
        <li>
          <strong>Family content you create</strong>: a family name, children's first names or
          nicknames, the chores/skills you track, points awarded, and reward choices. You decide
          what to enter — a nickname works fine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account &amp; billing</strong>: if you subscribe, your email and payment are
          handled by our processor, Stripe. We never see or store full card numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited product analytics</strong>: see below. We do <em>not</em> track individual
          children's tapping behaviour in a way that builds a profile of a child.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <H2>Children's data</H2>
      <p>
        PointPals is designed for a parent or guardian to use on a child's behalf. We collect the
        minimum needed to run the app. We do not build behavioural profiles of children, we do not
        use children's data for advertising, and we never sell personal data. Analytics events from
        kid-facing screens carry only an anonymous, non-reversible id — never a child's name.
      </p>

      <H2>Analytics &amp; error reporting</H2>
      <p>
        Any product analytics are scoped to parent-facing actions (settings, library management,
        subscription) to help us improve the app. There is no session recording on children's
        screens. Crash/error reports are scrubbed of personal information (names and emails) before
        they leave your device.
      </p>

      <H2>Where data lives</H2>
      <p>
        App data is stored on your device and, where a backend is connected, in our hosting provider
        (Supabase). Payment data is held by Stripe under their own privacy terms. Transactional
        emails (receipts, password resets) are sent via Resend.
      </p>

      <H2>Your controls</H2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
        <li>
          <strong>Export</strong>: download all your family data as JSON from Settings → Your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delete</strong>: permanently delete your family data from Settings → Your data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access questions</strong>: email us and we'll help.
        </li>
