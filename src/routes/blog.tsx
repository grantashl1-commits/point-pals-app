/* ── Blog Post 1: The Research Behind PointPals ── */
function ResearchPost() {
  return (
    <>

      <p>
        PointPals was built around a simple idea: children are more likely to contribute when they feel connected, capable and part of something meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        That does not mean every chore will suddenly become magical. Real family life is still real family life. Kids get tired. Parents get stretched. Routines fall apart. Some mornings are chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the way we frame chores matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        When chores become a daily power struggle, everyone loses. Parents feel ignored. Children feel controlled. The home becomes filled with reminders, negotiations and consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        PointPals takes a different approach. It turns chores, kindness and positive habits into visible family progress. Instead of focusing only on compliance, it helps families notice contribution.
      </p>
      <p>This article explains the thinking behind that approach.</p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">1. Children need connection, not constant correction</h3>
      <p>
        A useful starting point is Self-Determination Theory, a major theory of human motivation. It highlights three core psychological needs: autonomy, competence and relatedness. In simple terms, people tend to do better when they feel they have some choice, feel capable, and feel connected to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        That idea fits family life beautifully. A child who is constantly ordered around may complete a task, but they may not feel ownership over it. A child who feels trusted and included is more likely to see helping as part of who they are becoming.
      </p>
      <p>
        PointPals is designed to support this by making contribution visible without turning every moment into a lecture. When a child earns points for brushing teeth, making the bed or helping a sibling, they see evidence that they are capable. When those points fill a shared family jar, they see that their effort matters to everyone.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">2. Routines reduce friction</h3>
      <p>
        Parents often think behaviour is about motivation. Sometimes it is. But very often, family behaviour is about rhythm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research on family routines has found that consistent routines are associated with children&rsquo;s well-being and can provide both predictable structure and an emotional environment that supports development.
      </p>
      <p>
        That matters because chores are rarely isolated tasks. They sit inside routines. Morning routine. After-school routine. Dinner routine. Bedtime routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a task happens in the same place, at the same time and in the same sequence, it becomes easier. Children know what comes next. Parents do not have to start from zero every day.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">3. Rewards need to be handled carefully</h3>
      <p>
        A lot of parents worry about rewards, and rightly so. There is research suggesting that some types of expected tangible rewards can reduce intrinsic motivation, especially when rewards feel controlling or disconnected from meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        PointPals is not built around paying children for every action. It is designed around shared progress, visible contribution and family celebration.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a difference between: &ldquo;Do this or you do not get your prize&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your effort helped our family. Look how far we have come together.&rdquo; The first can feel like control. The second can feel like belonging.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">4. Contribution is more powerful than bribery</h3>
      <p>
        Michaeleen Doucleff&rsquo;s <em>Hunt, Gather, Parent</em> explores parenting practices from Maya, Inuit and Hadzabe families, with a strong focus on cooperation, emotional regulation and children being included in meaningful family life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many homes, children are entertained while adults do the work. Then, when parents suddenly need help, chores feel like an interruption. PointPals flips the framing: children are not outsiders being forced to do jobs. They are members of the family who can help.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">5. Screen-free rewards matter</h3>
      <p>
        Screens are part of modern family life, and they are not all bad. But PointPals works best when rewards are not only screen-based. A family reward might be pancakes on Saturday morning, a trip to the playground, movie night, baking together, or a board game night. The reward becomes another chance for connection.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">6. Small prompts make behaviour easier</h3>
      <p>
        BJ Fogg&rsquo;s behaviour model says behaviour happens when motivation, ability and a prompt come together at the same moment. PointPals helps by making chores clear, repeatable and easy to notice.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">7. Habits take time</h3>
      <p>
        You do not need to fix everything at once. Start with one routine. One child. One task. One marble. The goal is not instant perfection. The goal is steady practice.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">How PointPals applies the research</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> children can be involved in choosing goals and rewards.</li>
        <li><strong>Competence:</strong> children see proof that they can complete tasks and build habits.</li>
        <li><strong>Relatedness:</strong> points fill a shared jar, so progress belongs to the family.</li>
        <li><strong>Routine:</strong> chores become repeatable parts of daily life.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive reinforcement:</strong> effort is noticed and celebrated.</li>
        <li><strong>Screen-free connection:</strong> rewards can become family memories.</li>
        <li><strong>Small steps:</strong> families can start with easy wins and build from there.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="font-display font-bold mt-4">
        The real goal is not to make children chase points forever. The goal is to help families practise noticing effort.

      <p>
        PointPals is not meant to feel like a spreadsheet for chores. It is meant to feel warm, playful and encouraging — the kind of app children actually want to open with their family.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is where the PointPals characters come in. Each character has their own colour, symbol and personality. Together, they help turn everyday chores, kindness and positive habits into something children can understand and enjoy.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">How the characters work inside PointPals</h3>
      <p>
        The PointPals characters do more than decorate the app. They can help children understand different types of progress. Sunny appears for kindness points. Pip appears for learning. Bramble appears for chores and routines. Fern for care habits. Marlow for helping tasks. Coda for progress streaks. Ridge for resilience. Ziggy for rewards and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives PointPals a strong emotional world. Children are not just ticking boxes. They are building a collection of positive moments with characters who make each win feel special.
      </p>
      <p className="font-display font-bold mt-4">
        The PointPals characters make the app feel playful, but their purpose is deeper than cuteness. They turn values into something children can see.

function ChoresFunPost() {

      <p>
        Most parents do not want to nag. But chores have a way of turning even calm parents into broken record machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Put your shoes away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Please brush your teeth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Can you make your bed?&rdquo; Before long, everyone is annoyed. The child feels bossed around. The parent feels ignored. The chore still is not done.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is not to make chores optional. It is to make progress visible, shared and rewarding in a way that supports family connection.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Start with the reason, not the rule</h3>
      <p>
        Children are more likely to help when they understand why the job matters. Instead of &ldquo;Clear your plate because I said so,&rdquo; try &ldquo;When you clear your plate, it helps dinner clean-up go faster for everyone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Make the invisible visible</h3>
      <p>
        A big problem with chores is that children often cannot see progress. Adults can imagine the whole house running smoothly. Children usually cannot. They see one boring task in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why visual systems work so well. A chart, jar or app gives children something they can see. When a task is completed, something changes. A sticker appears. A marble drops. A point is added.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Keep the points simple</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>1 point for everyday chores</li>
        <li>2 points for bigger jobs</li>
        <li>3 points for extra helpful behaviour</li>
        <li>Bonus points for kindness, effort or trying something hard</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Choose family rewards, not just individual prizes</h3>
      <p>
        Family rewards feel different. When the jar fills, everyone celebrates together. The reward becomes a shared memory.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Make chores part of a routine</h3>
      <p>
        Try creating simple routine groups: Morning routine (make bed, get dressed, brush teeth, pack bag), After-school routine (shoes away, lunchbox out, homework), Evening routine (clear plate, bath, pyjamas, book).
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Celebrate effort, not perfection</h3>
      <p>
        A child does not need to complete a chore perfectly for the effort to matter. The first time a young child makes a bed, it may look like a blanket explosion. That is okay. &ldquo;I noticed you tried&rdquo; goes a long way.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Avoid turning points into threats</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of &ldquo;If you do not do this, you will not get points,&rdquo; try &ldquo;When this is done, we can add it to the jar.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Start small</h3>
      <p>
        Do not launch with thirty chores. Start with three. Choose tasks your child can realistically complete: brush teeth, put shoes away, clear plate. Once those feel normal, add more.
      </p>

      <p className="font-display font-bold mt-4">
        Chores do not need to feel like a daily fight. They can become small moments of contribution, confidence and connection.
      </p>
    </>

/* ── Blog Post 4: What Is a Marble Jar Reward System? ── */
function MarbleJarPost() {
  return (
    <>

      <p>
        A marble jar reward system is a simple way to help children see progress. When a child completes a chore, shows kindness or practises a positive habit, a marble goes into the jar. When the jar is full, the family celebrates with a reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        PointPals takes this classic idea and turns it into a digital family chore app, so families can track points, fill a shared jar and work toward rewards together.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Why marble jars work for children</h3>
      <p>
        Children often live in the present moment. They may not naturally connect today&rsquo;s small task with a bigger family goal. A marble jar helps bridge that gap.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a child makes their bed, a marble appears. When they brush their teeth, the jar fills a little more. The child can see that small actions add up.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">A shared jar encourages teamwork</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of &ldquo;I am earning more than you,&rdquo; it becomes &ldquo;We are filling the jar together.&rdquo; That shared goal is one of the most important parts of PointPals.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">What should children earn marbles for?</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Chores:</strong> making the bed, putting dishes away, feeding pets</li>
        <li><strong>Positive habits:</strong> brushing teeth, reading, getting dressed</li>
        <li><strong>Kindness:</strong> helping a sibling, sharing, apologising</li>
        <li><strong>Family contribution:</strong> helping cook, tidying shared spaces</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Common mistakes to avoid</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Making the jar too big:</strong> Start small. Let the family experience success early.</li>
        <li><strong>Using it only for chores:</strong> Kindness and effort deserve recognition too.</li>
        <li><strong>Taking points away too often:</strong> The jar works best when it is mostly about building progress.</li>
        <li><strong>Choosing rewards that create conflict:</strong> Create a family reward list together.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="font-display font-bold mt-4">
        A marble jar reward system is not about bribing children. Used well, it is about helping them see contribution. Every marble says: &ldquo;You helped.&rdquo;

/* ── Blog Post 5: Why Screen Time Is Not the Best Reward ── */
function ScreenTimePost() {

      <p>
        Screen time is an easy reward. It is quick. It is exciting. Children usually want it. Parents usually have access to it. &ldquo;Finish your chores and you can have the tablet.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no shame in this. Every parent reaches for the easy option sometimes. But when screen time becomes the main reward, it can create problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        PointPals was designed to help families build a different kind of reward system — one based on shared goals, family connection and memories.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Screens are not all bad</h3>
      <p>
        Digital media can support learning, creativity and social connection. The goal is not to panic about screens. The goal is to avoid making screens the only thing children work toward.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">The reward teaches children what matters</h3>
      <p>
        Rewards send a message. When the reward is always a device, children learn &ldquo;I help so I can escape into a screen.&rdquo; When the reward is a shared family experience, children learn &ldquo;I help because our family works together.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Better rewards do not have to cost money</h3>
      <p>
        Try: choosing the family dinner, pancakes on Saturday, a trip to a favourite playground, family movie night, baking cookies, camping in the lounge, one-on-one time with a parent, a board game night, a nature walk.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Keep screen rewards occasional, not automatic</h3>
      <p>
        A screen reward that disconnects: &ldquo;Go watch the tablet by yourself.&rdquo; A screen reward that connects: &ldquo;Tonight we are having family movie night with popcorn.&rdquo; The second one still involves a screen, but the centre of the reward is togetherness.
      </p>

      <p className="font-display font-bold mt-4">
        Use rewards to build memories. The points are the path. The reward is the memory.

        Children want to feel capable. They may not always show it when you ask them to put away shoes or clear the table, but most children enjoy feeling useful when the task is clear and achievable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The key is choosing chores that match their age, confidence and stage of development. A chore that is too hard creates frustration. A chore that is too easy may feel pointless. The right chore helps a child feel, &ldquo;I can do this.&rdquo;

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Chores for toddlers (2-3)</h3>

      <p>
        When a reward chart fills up, the last thing many parents want to hand over is another hour of screen time. It works in the moment, but it can quietly become the only reward that feels &ldquo;big enough,&rdquo; and the rest of family life starts to shrink around a screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news: kids do not actually need extra screen time to feel proud of their effort. They need <strong>connection, novelty, autonomy and a bit of ceremony</strong>. Below are more than 50 screen-free reward ideas, sorted by size, so you can slot them into a marble jar, a points app like PointPals, or a simple sticker chart.
      </p>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">What makes a reward actually motivating?</h3>
      <p>Before the list, three quick rules of thumb:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Time with you beats stuff.</strong> A 20-minute one-on-one walk is remembered far longer than a plastic toy.</li>
        <li><strong>Small and frequent beats huge and rare.</strong> Tiny wins keep momentum going between the big goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Let the child choose from a menu.</strong> Autonomy turns a reward from a bribe into a genuine celebration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Tiny rewards (a few points / everyday wins)</h3>
      <p>Perfect for a single good day, a chore streak, or clearing the daily list.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Choose the music in the car or kitchen</li>
        <li>Pick what&rsquo;s for dinner (from two options)</li>
        <li>Stay up 15 minutes later than usual</li>
        <li>A silly sticker or stamp on the hand</li>
        <li>One extra bedtime story</li>
        <li>Choose the family walk route</li>
        <li>Pick the vegetable for tonight&rsquo;s dinner</li>
        <li>A special &ldquo;proud of you&rdquo; note in the lunchbox</li>
        <li>Their favourite breakfast tomorrow</li>
        <li>Wear pyjamas all Saturday morning</li>
        <li>A tiny treat from the pantry &ldquo;secret shelf&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Sit in the front seat on the school run</li>
        <li>Pick the game at family game time</li>
        <li>Extra bubbles in the bath</li>
        <li>A trip to the letterbox with a parent, just the two of you</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Small rewards (a good week / a filled jar)</h3>
      <p>These take a little planning but almost nothing to run.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Backyard picnic dinner on a blanket</li>
        <li>Build a pillow fort and eat lunch inside it</li>
        <li>Bake something together — cookies, muffins, pancakes</li>
        <li>A trip to the library and choose 3 books</li>
        <li>Movie night at home with popcorn (parent-picked film if screen time is the reward, otherwise skip)</li>
        <li>Dance party in the lounge with disco lights off the phone torch</li>
        <li>Board game marathon</li>
        <li>Craft afternoon: paint, glue, glitter, chaos</li>
        <li>&ldquo;Yes day&rdquo; for one small hour</li>
        <li>Sleep in the lounge in a sleeping bag</li>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Medium rewards (a full jar / a big streak)</h3>
      <p>Save these for when a reward chart is genuinely full.</p>

      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Big rewards (family-wide goals)</h3>
      <p>These work best as a shared goal — the whole family fills the jar together.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>A day trip somewhere the kids chose</li>
        <li>Camping trip for a night</li>

      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">Connection-only rewards (the secret weapon)</h3>
      <p>
        These cost nothing and often mean the most. Add a handful to your reward menu and watch which ones get picked most often — the answer is usually surprising.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>15 minutes of undivided one-on-one time with a parent</li>
        <li>A long cuddle on the couch with no phones in sight</li>
        <li>Being the &ldquo;boss of dinner&rdquo; for one night</li>
        <li>A written note listing three things you love about them</li>
        <li>Interviewing a grandparent on speakerphone</li>
        <li>A walk-and-talk after dinner, just the two of you</li>
        <li>Reading a whole chapter book out loud together</li>
        <li>Teaching a parent a game <em>they</em> know</li>
        <li>Planning next weekend&rsquo;s family day together</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-display text-lg font-bold mt-5">How to use these with a reward chart or jar</h3>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Build a menu, not a promise.</strong> Write 5–10 options on a card. When the jar fills, the child picks from the menu.</li>
        <li><strong>Match the reward to the effort.</strong> Tiny rewards for daily wins, medium rewards for a filled jar, big rewards for a family-wide milestone.</li>
        <li><strong>Refresh the menu every month.</strong> Novelty is half the magic.</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate the reward, not just the prize.</strong> Take a photo of the pillow fort. Talk about the walk. Make the moment feel earned.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="font-display font-bold mt-4">
        The best screen-free reward is almost always the same thing wearing a different hat: your attention, on purpose, without a screen between you.
