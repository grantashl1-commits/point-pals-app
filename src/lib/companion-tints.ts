/**
 * companion-tints.ts —  Companion-to-marble-tint mapping.
 *
 * Every PointPals companion (mascot) has an associated marble colour drawn
 * from the MARBLE_TINT palette used by the <MarbleJar> canvas.  The mapping
 * below is the canonical source of truth: both the welcome page mascot parade
 * and the real family jar look up a kid's companionId here to decide the
 * colour of their marbles.
 *
 * The values match "The Mascots' Colour Story" blog post.  Where a
 * companion's `.color` field in mock-data differs from the colour story
 * (e.g. Ziggy is `sand` in data but `lilac` in the story), this map takes
 * precedence.  Unlisted companions fall back to their `.color` field.
